      <description>The movie &amp;ldquo;The Martian&amp;rdquo; ( starring Matt Damon) is a wonderful movie that has earned comments such as &amp;ldquo;Epic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The best movie on this or any other planet&amp;rdquo;. Based on a #1 New York Times bestselling novel, this science fiction movie is one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. &amp;ldquo;The Martian&amp;rdquo; is funnily enough rated PG-13 (parental guidence under the age of 13, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t already know).</description>

      <description>Like inside out,this movie is about feelings.
And like Zootopia,this movie is:REALLY REALLY AWSOMELY GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!
I like this movie because it is one of those movies that makes you cry and makes your insides soften.
This movie also teaches you a little bit about speaking out and saying somthing someone is doing is wrong and how to stay calm when saying it even if the porson your saying that to is someone that you really really love.</description>

      <description>zootopia is realy great.
I think it is a movie where you learn how some very difrent pepole(and animals) can get along.
My opinion of this movie is that its a very&amp;rsquo;kind hearted&amp;rsquo; movie, meaning most of the charecters are very kind hearted.
My favorite part of this movie was at the very beggening but i&amp;rsquo;m not going to give it away to you because the part is so funny and if I gave it away to you you would have known it already and then the part wouldent have ben funny.</description>

      <description>STARWARS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All of the movies are just greatly awsome.
My brother has a new bubble wand and he is pretending it is a light-saber.
If I see one of the movies I stare at it in awe like jedi&amp;rsquo;s are swash buckeling pirates.
I wish I was watching starwars right now.</description>

      <description>Now, this movie is difrent from all my other reveiews. This movie I must say, is worse than all the others. To me this movie is scary. You might ask why. I am going to tell you the most basic two reasons.
1:it&amp;rsquo;s sad 2:It creeps me out. And why would you ever wan&amp;rsquo;t to lose one of your friend&amp;rsquo;s like, forever? Sad right? And changing pink and grey when you&amp;rsquo;re sick, gross.</description>

      <description>so this is inside out. inside out isn&amp;rsquo;t that old. Inside out is all about feelings. And each feeling goes with a color. sadness-I bet you already know-blue. Red is for angry. Green-disgust. Yellow is for joy and puple-fear. I prefer amazing inside out for this movies title. If you just try it you&amp;rsquo;d definitely enjoy!</description>

      <description>Baby Buddy accidentally crawls into Santa&amp;rsquo;s bag at an orphanage and goes to Santa&amp;rsquo;s workshop in the North Pole! He grows fast and soon realizes he is not meant to be an elf! He sets out to find his dad and gets swept up in a wonderful adventure!
