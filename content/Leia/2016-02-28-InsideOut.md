so this is inside out. inside out isn't that old. Inside out is all about feelings. And each feeling goes with a color. sadness-I bet you already know-blue. Red is for angry. Green-disgust. Yellow is for joy and puple-fear. I prefer amazing inside out for this movies title. If you just try it you'd definitely enjoy!
