I first started learning to bake when I was 7 and a half years old.

Today I am VERY happy to entreduce you to a savory baked good.

So, sit in a comtrable spot, put on your reading glasses and enjoy!

Today I am going to proudly entriduce you to my first working recipy; a savory parsol.

Here are the ingreedients:

1 bag of rough puff pastry(I know,I wrote this only when I was 7)

1 big carrot

1 box of baby tomatos



1 WHOLE FOODS chicken

NOT put together with bag,3 handfulls cheese

1 small container sour cream

Half an avocado

How to bake it:

Using a sharp knife, chop the carrots and cut the tomatos.

Take out a pan and put it on the stove set to medium.

Slowly and carfuly, slide the vegtibals of the cutting board into the pan.

Cook the vegtibals for 5 minuts.

Evry munite, give the vegies a good stir.

Once the veggies are done, put them in a bowl.

Take some of the chiken and shred it with your fingers into the bowl.

Stir.

Now get your pastry.

Cut it in half and cut the halfs in half across 2 times.

Add about 2 spoonfuls of the veggie mix in each sqare.

Fold the bottum up after you made a bottumless triangle on 1 corner of the pastry and pinch to seal.

Brush on butter and place on a parchment - papered pan.

Bake for 5 minutes at 350 digrees.

when they are done,place on a cooling rack.

The dip:

Mash the avocado with some salt.

Stir in the cheese and sour cream.

ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
