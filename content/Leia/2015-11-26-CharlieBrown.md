Peppermint Patty invites herself and two friends to Charlie Brown's house for Thanksgiving dinner and he won't even be home!

I really liked this movie because  the  peanut gang movies are sooooo,funny!

Also,this movie includes a bonus epesode featuring the peanut gang sailing to their new land on the mayflower!

Try watching it,its amazing!

Also,snoopy makes a thanksgiving dinner like toast and popcorn and when the children go to charlie brown's grandma's house for thanksgiving dinner,snoopy and woodstock

eat the turkey,veggibles,and the pumpkin pie!

so you think snoopy is selfish,NO!

charlie brown was saposed to make the thanksgiving feast and he dident know how to cook!(but,snoopy helped.) 

you definitly won't change you'r mind!
