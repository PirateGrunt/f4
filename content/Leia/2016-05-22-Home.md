Like inside out,this movie is about feelings.

And like Zootopia,this movie is:REALLY REALLY AWSOMELY GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!

I like this movie because it is one of those movies that makes you cry and makes your insides soften.

This movie also teaches you a little bit about speaking out and saying somthing someone is doing is 
wrong and how to stay calm when saying it even if the porson your saying that to is someone that
you really really love.

In my opinion,this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen,and one of the reasons why is
because to me it has absalutly no scary parts.

My favorite fraze from this movie:"shake your boov thing!"

And just so you know,a boov is a made up alian that change colers with their feelings

Once again, this movie is really awsome!
