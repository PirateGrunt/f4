I am studying a book on cooking(It's my specialty) .

In it there is a recipy called "dutch oven bread";the one that inspiered me.

I am writting this to tell you some intresting(atleast to me) measurments on this dutch oven bread that I will explain to you after the measurments.

The regular measurments, 500 grams flour to 300 grams water.

Aditoin problums,1000 to 600, 2000 to 120,4000 to 240,8000 to 480,16000,to 8160,212000,to 162120.

Now explantoin:the second measurement is only doubling the first measurment so you can make as many loafs as you want.

that would really take days so i was really exadgerating.

you will find this in the book ruhlmans twenty.

page 155  chapter dough .
