Now, this movie is difrent from all my other reveiews. This movie I must say, is worse than all the others. To me this movie is scary. You might ask why. I am going to tell you the most basic two reasons.

1:it's sad 2:It creeps me out. And why would you ever wan't to lose one of your friend's like, forever? Sad right? And changing pink and grey when you're sick, gross.

I don't think so. This movie is one quite scary movie. It isn't quite for Miles either, so all i'm saying is this movie is scary. And i'm sorry (really, really, really sorry) if I just gave you or your family a nightmare.
