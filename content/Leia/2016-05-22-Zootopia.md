zootopia is realy great.

I think it is a movie where you learn how some very difrent pepole(and animals) can get along.

My opinion of this movie is that its a very'kind hearted' movie, meaning most of the charecters
are very kind hearted.

My favorite part of this movie was at the very beggening but i'm not going to give it away to you
because the part is so funny and if I gave it away to you you would have known it already and
then the part wouldent have ben funny.

If you have a lawyer in the family,there is another part that would make them laugh out loud
(seriosly,it happened to my grampa) 

I really enjoyed this movie(I could watch it right now) and I think you will to.
